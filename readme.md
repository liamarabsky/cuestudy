# Overview
CueStudy is a simplistic flaschard utility based in the web browser. It was created for the Hack the North 2020++ event.

## Pencil Format
The flashcards are read from a file uploaded by the user which conforms to a formatting standard which can be seen in action in the `provinces.txt` file.

The first entry is the cue and is proceeded by the delimiter ‚úê ( `U+2710` ) followed by the answer. These three items make up a single flashcard.
