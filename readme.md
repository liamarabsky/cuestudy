# Overview
CueStudy is a simplistic flaschard utility to be used in a web browser. It was created for the Hack The North 2020 event as an exercise in coding.

## Pencil Format
The flashcards are read from a file uploaded by the user which conforms to a formatting standard which can be seen in the `provinces.txt` file.

The first entry is the cue and is proceeded by the delimiter ‚úê ( `U+2710` ) followed by the answer. These three items make up a single flashcard.
